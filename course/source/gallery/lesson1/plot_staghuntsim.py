The stag hunt
=============

**Now you should study a model yourself!** Download the page as a 
Python notebook and fill in the missing code according to the instructions.


The model
---------

The stag hunt is modelled using the following payoff matrix. The dilemna is whether 
an individual should go hunting for a stag together with the group 
(which involves getting up early and driving to a desolate meeting place 
where your partner may of may not be wating for you) or hunt alone 
(which allows you to have a lie-in but means you only catch a rabbit). 
The payoffs are as follows:

=================== ============= ==============
individual/partner  Group (C)      Self (D)
=================== ============= ==============
Group (C)           1             :math:`S=-1/4`
Self (D)            :math:`T=1/2` 0
=================== ============= ==============

Write a replicator equation for this model. Start by finding the fitness of C and D. 
Then work out the average fitness.From there you can write down the replicator equation.

.. math::
  :label: stagsim

  \\frac{dx}{dt} = f(x) = ....

Use it to define the equation below.
