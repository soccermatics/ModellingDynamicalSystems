We will simulate the model using Python. Then we draw a phase plane \nfor the model.\n\n**Watch this first:** [Differential equations](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/differential-equations)\n\n## Differential equations\n\nIn the book, I write Lotka's equations in the form of chemical reactions, \ne.g. \n\n\\begin{align}\\mbox{F} +  \\mbox{R} \\rightarrow 2 \\mbox{F}\\end{align}\n\nThis means that an F and R together becomes two F's. Parker expalins as follows,\n\nIMAGE FROM BOOK HERE\n\nWhile in Leipzig, A. J. Lotka learnt how chemical reactions can be used to \nspecify the rate of change of populations, i.e. in terms of the derivates \nabove, using an approach, known as the law of mass action. \nThe idea is to think about the rate at which these chemical reactions take place. \nFor the first reaction \n\n\\begin{align}\\mbox{R} \\xrightarrow{a} 2 \\mbox{R}\\end{align}\n\nWe can think of $a$ as being the rate of reproduction of the rabbits, \nhow many baby rabbits an adult rabbit has per day. So, the rabbits grow \naccording to \n\n\\begin{align}:label: rabbitgrow\n\n   \\frac{dR}{dt} = a R\\end{align}\nThis equation denotes the rate of change of $R$ over time. \nthe top part of the fraction $dR$ denotes the change in rabbits, $R$, \nand the bottom part, $dt$, denotes the change in time, $t$. \n\nThis type of equation, known as a differential equation can appear a bit strange \nthe first rime we encounter it. When we first meet differntiation in school\nwe write, for example,\n\n\\begin{align}:label: timeint\n\n   R(t) = \\frac{1}{2} a t^2\\end{align}\n\n\nthen take the derivative to get \n\n\\begin{align}:label: timegrow\\end{align}\n \n   \\frac{dR}{dt} = a t\n\n  \nThis is also a differential equation. It says that the rate of change of $R$ over time\nis proportional to time. The modelling difference between equation :eq:`timegrow` and \n:eq:`rabbitgrow` is that the former says that rabbits grow proportionally to time, while\nthe latter says that rabbits grow proportionally to the number of rabbits. In the case that\nrabbits grow in proportion to time, then we say that :eq:`timeint` is the solution to \nequation :eq:`timegrow` since it tells us how many rabbits there \nwill be at any point in time. I think this is where differential equations can be a bit\nconfusing, because in school we are usually given :eq:`timeint` and asked to find :eq:`timegrow`. \nFor most differential equations it is the other way round. We are given equation :eq:`rabbitgrow` \nand asked to find the the number of rabbits $R$ as a function of time. \n\nWe aren't going to solve these equations yet. First we need to have the equations for foxes. In chemical \nreaction form these are,\n\n\\begin{align}\\mbox{F} +  \\mbox{R} \\xrightarrow{b}  2 \\mbox{F}\\end{align}\n\nfor foxes eating rabbits and\n\n\\begin{align}\\mbox{F}   \\xrightarrow{d}  \\mbox{D}\\end{align}\nfor foxes dying. Converted to differential equations, the rate of change for rabbits becomes\n\n\\begin{align}:label: rabbits\\end{align}\n \n   \\frac{dR}{dt} = \\underbrace{a R}_{\\mbox{R} \\xrightarrow{a} 2 \\mbox{R}} - \\underbrace{b R F}_{\\mbox{F} + \\mbox{R} \\xrightarrow{b} 2 \\mbox{F}}\n\nSimilarly, we can write the rate of change of foxes as \n\n\\begin{align}:label: foxes\\end{align}\n \n   \\frac{dF}{dt} =  \\underbrace{c R F}_{\\mbox{F} + \\mbox{R} \\xrightarrow{c} 2 \\mbox{F}} - \\underbrace{d R}_{\\mbox{R} \\xrightarrow{d} 2 \\mbox{R}}\n\nNotice that we have a different rate parameter for the death of rabbits ($b$) \nthan for the birth of foxes ($c$). This is because\nit takes more than one rabbit to feed a fox and we set the parameters so that $c<b$.\n\nIt may seem strange to treat rabbits and foxes as chemicals.  \nAs we all know, two rabbits are needed to produce baby rabbits and when a fox eats a rabbit, \nit doesn\u2019t simply transform it directly in to a new fox, as the chemical equation suggests. \nAlso, in the description above, the grass is not depleted: there is no chemical equation \ndescribing how grass is transformed to rabbit poop. But the point of a mathematical model \nlike this is not to be entirely realistic. Rather, it tries to capture the essence of the problem. \nWe want to imagine a big grassy meadow, where the more rabbits there are, the faster the rabbit \npopulation grows and the more foxes there are the faster the rabbits are eaten. We will try to \nunderstand this abstract problem first, before we make any claims about what happens to real \nrabbits and real foxes. \n\n\n\n\n## Simulating the model\n\nIn this section we use Python to run a numerical simulation of the model.\n"

        "## A look at Lotka's orginal article\nTo find the exact shape of this rotation, we can use a trick that Lotka \ndescribed in an article he wrote in 1920. By dividing the rabbit equation by the fox equation he got \n\n\\begin{align}\\frac{dR}{dF} = \\frac{aR -bRF}{cRF - d F}\\end{align}\n\nWe can then rearrange this equation to get \n\n\\begin{align}\\left(c -d/R \\right) dR = \\left(a/F -b \\right) dF\\end{align}\n\nIntegrating both sides ofthis equation we get \n\n\\begin{align}cR -d\\log(R) = a \\log(F) - b F + C\\end{align}\n\nwhere $C$  is the constant of integration. This last equation tells us a relationship that \nmust always hold between rabbits and foxes. To understand what the relationship implies, \nimagine  the equation above was simply $Y+X=C$  instead. This would imply the total number of \nrabbits and foxes is equal to C=10. So, if $C=10$ then we could have $Y=3$ foxes and $X=7$ \nrabbits (because 3+7=10), \nor 6 foxes and 4 rabbits (because 6+4=10), but we couldn\u2019t have $Y=6$ foxes and $X=7$ rabbits (because 6+7\u226010). \nIn our case, the relationship in the equation is more complicated, involving logarithms, but the idea is the \nsame: it says that for any particular value of C all values of  X and Y must obey this equation.  \nImagine for example, we started with X=4 rabbits and Y=6 foxes.
