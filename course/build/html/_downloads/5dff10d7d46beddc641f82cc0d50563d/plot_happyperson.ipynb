        "\n# Happy individual\n\n**Imagine, after you have paid your bills, you have more than $200 per month to spend divided between three \ncategories: (1) material items, (2) experiences and (3) time-saving services. How should you \nspend this money in order to be as happy as possible?**\n\nHere we try to answer this question using a questionnaire \nconducted by Whillans et al. (2017). We look in particular at 1067 people with varying incomes, \nbut all with a budget of at least $200 to spend.  The study participants typically \nspent about $250 on (each of) material items and experiences, and about half as much on time-saving.   \n\nAll the participants were asked the question:\n\nPlease imagine a ladder with steps numbered from zero at the bottom to ten at the top. \nSuppose we say that the top of the ladder represents the best possible life for you and the bottom of \nthe ladder represents the worst possible life for you. On which step of the ladder would you say you \npersonally feel you stand at this time?\n\nThis is how the researchers measure happiness. \n"
